# Reddit Post Downloader

A simple python script to download any kind of Reddit Posts.

## Requirements

[FFMPEG is required!](https://www.ffmpeg.org)

### **You also need to have FFMPEG on PATH.**

After downloading or building FFMPEG, put the 'bin' folder inside the PATH environmental variable.

## Usage

If you want to import this into another script, you could simply do: 

```py
import RedditDownloader as reddit_dl
reddit_dl.download_reddit(url)
```

If you like my work, I will be uploading an Instagram Post (except stories) downloader and maybe others when I document them, so stay tuned!
